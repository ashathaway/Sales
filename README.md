# Sales

This project is from my internship as a Data Scientist. The goal of the project is to predict the amount of time it will take to for the sales department to complete a quote. The light gradient boosted model uses Salesforce data that I pulled using SOQL Workbench queries. 

The project all lives in 'Sales.ipynb'.
